This repository is a quick example using `libusb` for future me
to reference.

## Official libusb on GitHub

See `libusb` examples on GitHub:

https://github.com/libusb/libusb/blob/master/examples

In particular, these are the examples I looked at:

- [the Cypress EZUSB example](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/blob/master/examples/ezusb.c)
- [the "list USB devices" example](https://github.com/libusb/libusb/blob/master/examples/listdevs.c)

## libusb docs

https://libusb.sourceforge.io/api-1.0/libusb_api.html

## My docs

See [HELPME.md](HELPME.md) for beginner explanations like how to
build an executable.

I also put information here that I find useful or interesting
while writing `main.cpp` but that was too big to leave as a code
comment. Like what is this data type or what does this API call
do.
